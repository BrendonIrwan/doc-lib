NCH Hijack Cure (NCH_JACK.TXT)

Synopsis
--------
NCH Software is known for their VideoPad video editor, which used to be one of
the best free video editing software. Today (at the time of writing), I
recognize it as one of the few intermediate, non-linear video editors for
Windows.

However, there are a number of major issues, all of which would have been let
downs for others. This writing covers one of them which applies to pretty much
every NCH Software product:

    Upon program installation, file associations are hijacked to advertise their
    range of products. A fine marketing strategy indeed (sarcasm). For example,
    opening a ZIP file will bring up a message to install ExpressZIP, another
    NCH Software product. This also applies to paid software, wow really?

In this writing I will cover a number of methods to get away from the above
issue--and here they are...


Method I - See It? Fix It.
--------------------------
This is what I used to do, and is recommended for most people.

If you see a file type that has been hijacked, all you have to do is to
reassociate this file type into a program of your desire. To do this:

1.  View file properties (File -> Properties)
2.  On the window that appears, tap [Change...]
3.  Select your program of desire
4.  Tap [OK] to save changes

This method may seem distracting at first, but it will diminish overtime.


Method II - Brutal
------------------
As you may have guessed, this method involves tinkering around the Windows
registry, a very crucial component of the operating system. It is possible for a
breakage to leave the system to haywire. If you wish to proceed, I suggest you
to create a system restore point in case bad things happen to you.

Anyways, The hijack is simply an invasion to the registry. Luckily, most of them
identify themselves with the NCH keywords so let us use that as a base search
term. Without further ado, here goes:

1.  Start Windows Registry Editor (regedit)
2.  Point to the root of the hiearchy (Computer)
3.  Open the Find dialog box ([ctrl+f] or Edit -> Find)
4.  Look at: [X]Keys [X]Values [X]Data
5.  Enter the search term: NCH
6.  Tap [Find Next]

From here you have to be careful, common sense applies:

7A. If a data is found, usually under the (Default) values, empty its contents
    (NOT DELETING THE VALUE NOR KEY)

7B. If a value is found, usually under the OpenWithProgId keys, delete it

7C. If a key is found, stop iterating; you are finished with step 7, and read on

7D. Iterate over the entire HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, [f3] to find for the next match

Point back to the root of the registry. You will now perform a series of
searches. Here are the terms I gathered so far:

-   NCHconvertdoc
-   NCHconvertimage
-   NCHconvertvideo
-   NCHextract
-   NCHslideshow

These are keys to be deleted when found. VideoPad users might want to get rid of
relevant keys to when searching for NCHconvertvideo such as "Add to VideoPad
project" and "Stabilize video". Also remember to stop if you reach outside
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT. That is it.


Method III - Avoid
------------------
If you wish not to face this (ever again), it is best to avoid NCH Software for
now (or forever as this has been around for long years). Go look for
alternatives, though I can not say much in the video editing department.


Conclusion
----------
NCH Software needs to change the way they market their products. The practice
they are doing is similar to that of malwares and alike, causing some security
software to flag them as threats. I have not heard of any other software company
being this brutal.

If they really want their customers to use all NCH Software products, they are
better off making program suites or better yet, wrap them into an operating
system.

And finally, if you worry that this cure will break your system, don't. I did
method II at this very computer on which I am writing this document, no problems
encountered.
